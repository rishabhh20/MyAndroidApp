# MyAndroidApp
We as a potential engineers invent, design, analyze, build and test machines, gadgets, complex systems to fulfill functional objectives and requirements while considering the limitations imposed by practicality, regulation, safety and cost.
Here I am also one of those trying to create something new in order to explore my limited knowledge and enhance my skill set.
This is my first ever Android Application that I have developed with diligence in order to learn and create something better.I call this app as “Expense Manager”
